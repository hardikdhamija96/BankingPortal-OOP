### **Task 1: Classes and Objects**

#### **Goal:**

Establish the foundational structure of the banking portal by creating and using basic classes and objects in JavaScript.

#### **Objectives:**

1.  **Define Core Classes**:

    -   **`Account`**: Represents a bank account with functionalities to manage balance.
    -   **`Customer`**: Represents a bank customer with associated information.
    -   **`Bank`**: Manages multiple accounts and customers.
2.  **Implement Basic Methods**:

    -   **`Account`**:
        -   `deposit(amount)`: Method to deposit money into the account.
        -   `withdraw(amount)`: Method to withdraw money from the account.
    -   **`Customer`**:
        -   `getCustomerInfo()`: Method to return customer details.
    -   **`Bank`**:
        -   `addAccount(account)`: Method to add a new account.
        -   `addCustomer(customer)`: Method to add a new customer.
        -   `getCustomerAccounts(customerID)`: Method to retrieve accounts associated with a specific customer.
3.  **Instantiate Objects**:

    -   Create instances of `Account`, `Customer`, and `Bank` classes.
    -   Use the methods defined in these classes to perform basic operations.
4.  **Demonstration Script**:

    -   Write a script that shows how to use the classes and methods to perform typical banking operations. This script will demonstrate the creation and interaction with objects without formal testing.
